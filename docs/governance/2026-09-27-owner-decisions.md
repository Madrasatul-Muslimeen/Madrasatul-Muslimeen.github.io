# Owner decisions — 27 Sep 2026

Recorded by the MMSA Architect, in the Owner's own words where given. Binding
until the Owner changes them; a later session must not ask these again.

Context: the Owner asked *"How do i attempt an approach and claim it while i am
on Mushaf view? Show me your thought, a demo."* The Architect published a
clickable mock-up (https://claude.ai/artifact/27UcbuvPMQKRU3ci1RA6KC) showing
today's route (tap the āyah-end marker → Ayah Card → "Take an Approach", which
saves Learning only) and a proposal. The Owner answered on the demo:

| # | Question | Owner's answer | What it means |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | A one-time hint strip under the top bar ("Tap ۝ for one āyah · tap the title for this page"). | **"Don't make another bar."** | No hint strip or any new bar in Mushaf view. |
| 2 | How an āyah is chosen in Mushaf view. | **"Put the Ayah sign only for selecting an Ayah."** | The āyah-end marker (۝ with its number) is the one way to select an āyah. |
| 3 | The page card's default: every āyah on the page, or the page as one unit? | **"Page should come as 'this page as one unit'."** | Tapping the top-bar Surah/āyāt reference (v08.89) opens a **This page** card whose Approach claim is on the existing `page` Study Unit (one record, `subject_quran` chunk). |
| 4 | Should a page claim also fill each āyah? | **"Keep Ayah has It's separate approach because we want to encourage for Ayah study."** | A page claim never writes āyah claims. Āyah claims are made only from the āyah's own card, and stay separate from page claims. The "every āyah on this page" option is **not** built. |
| 5 | Four statuses, or just Learning · Achieved? | **"Keep all 4 stage."** | Both cards show Not started · Learning · Practising · Achieved for the chosen Approach. Achieved goes through confirmation where the Madrasah requires it, as today. |
